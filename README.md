# Password Manager

This is a simple command-line tool for generating passwords and storing them in a file. The tool generates passwords based on user input, and appends each generated password to a file called password.txt in the current directory.

## Usage 

To run the program, navigate to the directory containing the "main.py" file using the terminal and enter the following command:

python main.py


The program will then prompt you for the following information:

- Password Length
- Complexity Level
- Name of service or site
- Username

After entering this information, the program will generate a password and display it on the terminal. It will also append the password to the password.txt file in the current directory.

You can run the program as many times as you like to generate multiple passwords. Each password will be appended to the password.txt file on a new line.
